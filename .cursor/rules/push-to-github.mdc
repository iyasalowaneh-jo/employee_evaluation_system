# Push changes to GitHub

When you complete a set of code changes to this project (employee_evaluation_system):

1. **Stage** all changes: `git add -A`
2. **Commit** with a short, clear message describing what changed (e.g. "Fix completion rate to include 360", "Add export for cycle results")
3. **Push** to GitHub: `git push origin` (or `git push`)

- Run these from the project root: `c:\Users\DP\employee_evaluation_system`
- Use PowerShell-compatible commands (e.g. `;` not `&&` for chaining if needed)
- If there are no changes or nothing to commit, skip the commit/push
- Request `git_write` for add/commit and `network` or `full_network` for push
